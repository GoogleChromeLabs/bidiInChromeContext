# WebDriver BiDi for Chromium [![chromium-bidi on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/chromium-bidi)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromium-bidi)

This is an implementation of the
[WebDriver BiDi](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/) protocol for Chromium,
implemented as a JavaScript layer translating between BiDi and CDP, running
inside a Chrome tab.

Current status can be checked here:

.

# Setup

This is a Node.js project, so install dependencies as usual:

```sh
npm install
```

# Starting the Server

This will run the server on port 8080:

```sh
npm run server
```

Use the `PORT=...` environment variable or `--port=...` argument to run it on
another port:

```sh
PORT=8081 npm run server
npm run server -- --port=8081
```

Use the `DEBUG` environment variable to see debug info:

```sh
DEBUG=* npm run server
```

Use the CLI argument `--headless=false` to run browser in headful mode:

```sh
npm run server -- --headless=false
```

Use the `CHANNEL=...` environment variable or `--channel=...` argument with one
of the following values to run the specific Chrome channel: `chrome`,
`chrome-beta`, `chrome-canary`, `chrome-dev`.

The requested Chrome version should be installed.

```sh
CHANNEL=chrome-dev npm run server
npm run server -- --channel=chrome-dev
```

## Starting on Linux and Mac

TODO: verify if it works on Windows.

You can also run the server by using script `./runBiDiServer.sh`. It will write
output to the file `log.txt`:

```sh
./runBiDiServer.sh --port=8081 --headless=false
```

# Running

## Unit tests

Running:

```sh
npm run unit
```

## e2e tests

The e2e tests are written using Python, in order to learn how to eventually do
this in web-platform-tests.

### Installation

Python 3.6+ and some dependencies are required:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user -r tests/requirements.txt
```

### Running

The e2e tests require BiDi server running on the same host. By default, tests
try to connect to the port `8080`. The server can be run from the project root:

```sh
npm run e2e
```

Use the `PORT` environment variable to connect to another port:

```sh
PORT=8081 npm run e2e
```

## Examples

The examples are stored in the `/examples` folder and are intended to show who
the BiDi protocol can be used. Examples are based on
[Puppeteer's examples](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/tree/main/examples)
.

### Instalation

The examples are written using Python, to align with e2e test. Python 3.6+ and
some dependencies are required:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user -r tests/requirements.txt
```

### Running

The examples require BiDi server running on the same host on the port `8080`.
The server can be run from the project root:

```sh
npm run server
```

After running server, examples can be simply run:

```sh
python3 examples/cross-browser.py
```

## WPT

WPT is added as
a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). To get
run WPT tests:

### Check out WPT and setup

#### 1. Check out WPT

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

#### 2. Go to the WPT folder

```sh
cd wpt
```

#### 3. Set up virtualenv

Follow the [_System
Setup_](https://web-platform-tests.org/running-tests/from-local-system.html#system-setup)
instructions.

#### 4. Setup `hosts` file

Follow
the [`hosts` File Setup](https://web-platform-tests.org/running-tests/from-local-system.html#hosts-file-setup)
instructions.

##### On Linux, macOS or other UNIX-like system

```sh
./wpt make-hosts-file | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

##### And on **Windows**

This must be run in a PowerShell session with Administrator privileges:

```sh
python wpt make-hosts-file | Out-File $env:SystemRoot\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Encoding ascii -Append
```

If you are behind a proxy, you also need to make sure the domains above are
excluded from your proxy lookups.

#### 5. Set the `WPT_BROWSER_PATH` environment variable to a Chrome, Edge or Chromium binary to launch. For example, on macOS:

```sh
export WPT_BROWSER_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Canary"
export WPT_BROWSER_PATH="/Applications/Microsoft Edge Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge Canary"
export WPT_BROWSER_PATH="/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium"
```

### Run WPT tests

#### 1. Build ChromeDriver BiDi

```sh
npm run build
```

#### 2. Run

```sh
./wpt/wpt run \
  --webdriver-binary ./runBiDiServer.sh \
  --binary "$WPT_BROWSER_PATH" \
  --manifest ./wpt/MANIFEST.json \
  --metadata ./wpt-metadata \
  chromium \
  webdriver/tests/bidi/
```

### Update WPT expectations if needed

#### 1. Run WPT tests with custom `log-wptreport`:

```sh
./wpt/wpt run \
  --webdriver-binary ./runBiDiServer.sh \
  --binary "$WPT_BROWSER_PATH" \
  --manifest ./wpt/MANIFEST.json \
  --metadata ./wpt-metadata \
  --log-wptreport wptreport.json \
  chromium \
  webdriver/tests/bidi/
```

#### 2. Update expectations based on the previous test run:

```sh
./wpt/wpt update-expectations \
  --product chromium \
  --manifest ./wpt/MANIFEST.json \
  --metadata ./wpt-metadata \
  ./wptreport.json
```

# How does it work?

The architecture is described in the
[WebDriver BiDi in Chrome Context implementation plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VfQ9tv0wPSnb5TI-MOobjoQ5CXLnJJx9F_PxOMQc8kY)
.

There are 2 main modules:

1. backend WS server in `src`. It runs webSocket server, and for each ws
   connection runs an instance of browser with BiDi Mapper.
2. front-end BiDi Mapper in `src/bidiMapper`. Gets BiDi commands from the
   backend, and map them to CDP commands.

## Contributing

The BiDi commands are processed in the `src/bidiMapper/commandProcessor.ts`. To
add a new command, add it to `_processCommand`, write and call processor for it.
